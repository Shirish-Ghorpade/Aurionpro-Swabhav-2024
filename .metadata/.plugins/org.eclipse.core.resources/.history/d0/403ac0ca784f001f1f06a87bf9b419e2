//	We can copy the one object to another object when we use class
//	In this approach it is tightly coupled
//	what about the interface?
//	So, Solution is prototype design pattern ---> delegates the object duplication or cloning process to actual objects that are being closed
	
	
//	creates a new object of the class and copies all the fields of the old object to the new one. --> we have acess of private fields also
